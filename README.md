# UserInterfaceDesign

The given attached file has midium fidelity prototype, and it was a team project.

We have developed a user interface which provides a COVID-19 self assessment, BC provincial
statistics, and testing facility information. We have different screens which will solve
different problems. One such example is giving user access to a heat map of the BC which is
accessible by clicking on a button named “View Map”. This interface helps everyone
interested or concerned with COVID-19, but our target audience are senior citizens.

As soon as user will open the application, it will show the welcome message and shows the covid statistics in BC province.
Main screen has three buttons diagnose me, view map, and privay policy. If user want to do the self assessment of COVID-19 then they can 
click on the diagnose me button, as soon as user will click that button it will open the diagnose me screen where user can given the answer of the provided questions. It was a progress bar user, user can reset all the asnwers. Once user is stisfied with the answers they can click on the submit button. After submitting the response it will show user that they have a COVID-19 symptoms or not, and also provide the button for checking the nearest testing facility is available near by them.

User can go to main screen by click on the home button the top right corner of all the screens. If user is on the main screen and they want to see the heat map of the BC then they can click on the view map button and it will show view map screen. This screen has three other buttons like nearest testing facility, statistics, and facility details.

If user want to see the statistics of their area then they can click on this button and it will take user to that page. On this page user can choose any region inside the BC province and they can see all the data of COVID-19 within that region.

User can also go to nearest testing facility from the view map screen, but user have to allow the access location permission before visiting to the nearest testing facility screen, and it will differnt facility near by that location, and if they will click on the facility1 then it will take them to the facility details page where they can find more information about that facility, and if user want to check out other facility details then they can by just clicking on that facility number.

If user has a concerned about the privacy and their data then user can visit the privacy policy page by clicking on the privcy policy page from the main screen.

Thank you!
